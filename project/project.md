## Abstract

In behavioral economics, it is said that emotions have an effect on individual's behavior and their choice in their decision making process. This can be true for a society at large but can this apply to the leader of the free world? Here we will investigate the collective mood of President Trump's tweets are correlated to the value of the Nasdaq Stock Market (NASDAQ) during certain events during his presidency. The applications of sentiment analysis will help find the correlation that we are looking for. President Trump's tweets will be used to analyze the mood and the NASDAQ movements.

## 1. Introduction

Financial markets have been an area of research in both academia and business. Analysis and predictions has been growing in its accuracy with an every increasing amount of data used to test these models. "The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) states that stock market prices are largely driven by *new* information and follow a random walk pattern"[^1]. This shows that prices will follow news rather than previous and present prices. Information is unpredictable in terms of its release/publication showing market prices will follow a random walk pattern and the prediction can not be high. 

There are some problems that arise with EMH. One problem is that "stock prices does not follow a random walk pattern and can be predicted to a certain degree"[^2]. Another problem associated with EMH is with the information's unpredictability, the unpredictability is called into question with the introduction of social media (Facebook, Twitter, blogs). The rise of social media can be a early indicator for news before it is released/published. This project will analyze the market based on how the President tweets during certain events. 

## 2. DataSets

In this project, two datasets will be used - 
* The NASDAQ values from November 2016 to January 2020. This data was obtained through Yahoo! Finance and includes Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume for a given day.

* President Trump's tweets during the periods of November 2016 to January 2020 is over 41,000 tweets. The data includes id, link, content, date, retweets, favorites, mentions, hashtags, and geo for every tweet in the time frame. Since the performance of the analysis is on a daily basis, tweets will be split up by Date. This data is available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/trump-tweets?select=trumptweets.csv).


To strengthen the analysis, even more, some code from the 2016 electionâ€™s analysis of markets may be utilized but the focus will be on the markets during the Trump administration. Rally data maybe introduced in order to have a deeper sense of some of the tweets when it comes to important news that is announces at President Trump's rallies. In order to have a realistic and strong analysis, the financial data needs to be aligned with the timing of tweets but news that has already started to affect the markets before a tweet has been sent out needs to be taken into account.  

## 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The data obtained needs to be cleaned and pre-processed in order to make it reliable for analysis through the use of Pandas, Regex, and Matplotlib.  

### 3.1 Twitter Data

When importing the Twitter data, there are several things that are noticed when printing the first five rows. Three of the columns mention, hashtags, and geo are currently showing NaN. After calculating the missing values, all the values in these columns are missing or are zero so we can drop these columns from the dataframe.

The tweets are one of the last columns needed to be cleaned. The text of the tweets needs to be uniformed in order to conduct analysis. Removing punctuations was the first step followed by removing content specifically seen in tweets. These could be the word retweet, the hashtag symbol(#), the @ symbol followed by a username, and any hyperlinks that could be in a tweet. 

### 3.2 Stock Data

Stock data has a unique set of challenges when it comes to cleaning. Unlike tweets, stock data is only available Monday through Friday and is not available for holidays that the market is closed. In order to have a complete dataset, several options are available. One option is to drop the tweets that fall on a weekend. This would not be useful since markets can react to news that happens on the weekend. Another option is that "if the NASDAQ value on a given day is x and the next available data point is y with n days missing in between, we approximate the missing data by estimating the first day after x to be (y+x)/2 and then following the same method recursively till all gaps are filled" [^1].

## 4. Methodology/Process

The collection of finance and Twitter data will be used to visualize the results. Some of Twitter or dataset data will need to be cleaned and classified to build the model. The methodology is composed of the following steps:

* Use data from President Trump's personal twitter to help visualize and create the model
* Use data from Yahoo finance API to help visualize and create the model
* Data cleaning and extraction.
* New data will be updated to keep up with the current time. 

## 5. Preliminary Analysis and EDA

### 5.1 Twitter Data

When starting to conduct preliminary analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA), it is helpful to first check for any null values in the data and there are no null values in the twitter data. 

The date column is a column that is needed to track the amount of tweets per month and year. In the column, the timestamp and the date are combined so this need to be separated in several ways. The first being separating the date from the timestamp into its own column. This is followed up by separating the date into 4 columns for day, month, year and month-year in order to track tweets based on specified criteria. 

After graphing the amount of tweets per year, the observation is that 2016 and 2020 have a low tweet count. The reminder is that the data starts in November 2016 making 2016 have two months of data compared to 2020 with only one month being January. From 2017 through 2019, we can see that the amount of tweets increases by almost a thousand every year. The tweets per month tell a different story. The amount varies greatly over the years with the greatest amount being near the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017.

### 5.2 Stock Data

Similar to the twitter data, checking for null values is important but since the data is from Yahoo! Finance there are no missing values on the days that the markets are opened. 

Once graphing the open and closed prices of the NASDAQ, there seems to be an general upwards trend in the market over the time period.

## 6. Defining events during Trump's presidency

### 6.1 The Impeachment of President Trump

After weeks of talks among Congress, the House of Representatives have voted to impeach President Trump on two charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress on December 18, 2019. Since the country's founding in 1776, only three presidents have faced impeachment from Congress: Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and now Donald Trump. This move has been widely advocated for since his election in 2016. "In September 2019, news leaked of a phone call between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky regarding an investigation into Hunter Biden, son of then Democratic candidate Joe Biden, for his dealings in Ukraine" [^3]. Sentiment analysis was preformed on tweets that fall in the time frame of President Trump's impeachment as shown below.

### 6.2 The Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines approval

One of the first moves President Trump made when arriving into office was to approve the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. "Both of the pipelines were blocked by the Obama administration due to environmental concerns, but President Trump has questioned climate change and promised to expand energy infrastructure and create jobs"[^4]. The Keystone pipeline would span 1,200 miles across six states, moving over 800,000 barrels of oil daily from Canada to the Gulf coast. The Dakota Access pipeline would move oil from North Dakota all the way to Illinois. "The Standing Rock Sioux tribe, whose reservation is adjacent to the pipeline, staged protests that drew thousands of climate change activists to the rural area of Cannon Ball, North Dakota" [^4].

### 6.3 The Government Shutdown

On December 21, 2018 the United States Government shutdown. "At the heart of the dispute is Trump's demand for just over $5 billion toward a long-promised wall along the US-Mexico border" [^5]. The shutdown affected a part of the federal government such as homeland security, transportation, and agriculture. "The problems caused by the shutdown are wide-ranging, from waste piling up in national parks to uncertainty for 800,000 federal workers about when their next paycheck will come" [^5]. This shutdown was the longest shutdown in the modern era coming to an end on January 25, 2019 after 35 days.
